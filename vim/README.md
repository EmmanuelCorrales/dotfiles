Vim setup and configuration files
======
My OSX and Ubuntu configurations.

Installation
------
Execute the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
cd dotfiles/vim
./setup
```
This will overwrite the the **_.vimrc_** file in the home direcotory.

### Typescript
Plugins for Typescriot aren't installed automatically with the **_setup_** script.

#### Warning</h3>
**_typescript-setup_** installs the plugin [tsuquyomi](https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi).
  I noticed that it made vim open typescript files slower while using it on my Mac.

Execute the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
cd dotfiles/vim
./typescript-setup
```
